far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries 
Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they 
live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large 
language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and 
supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic 
country, in which roasted parts of sentences [fly into your mouth](www.example.tld).

Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it
is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind
text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of
Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were
thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but
the Little Blind Text didn't listen.

She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made
herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic
Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown
Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of
her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her
cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy. The copy
warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
been rewritten a thousand times.
